# EcoSystem

A simple ecosystem simulation, heavily inspired by Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventure series. Features a predator-prey dynamic between foxes and rabbits, where each species has distinct behaviours and interactions. The foxes hunt the rabbits for food, while the rabbits reproduce and attempt to avoid predators. The simulations allows for the evolution of traist such as speed and hunger tolerance, leading to natural selection over time. 

# Procedural Generation

I’ve added procedural generation using a grid-based system to create the terrain. The system lets me generate different types of terrain, like grass, sand, water, and deep water, giving the ecosystem a variety of landscapes. I’ve set it up so that the terrain is placed randomly or based on specific rules, which means the environment looks different every time the simulation runs. I’ve also used this same system to spawn trees and bushes, which will be used in pathfinding & as a food source. It’s been fun experimenting with procedural generation, as it makes the environment feel more dynamic and unpredictable.
